## Vite 5 Overview

Vite 5 delivers a faster, smarter, and more flexible development experience. Here's what's new:

- Smarter dependency pre-bundling with the upgraded `esbuild++` engine
- Native module federation for micro-frontend architectures
- Incremental HMR (Hot Module Replacement) with no config required

Thanks to the upgraded engine and caching strategy, cold start times are now up to **40% faster**. Module federation support means teams can finally share code across apps without resorting to workarounds.

### Final Thoughts

Vite 5 isn’t just an upgrade—it’s a statement. It redefines how fast and smooth local development can be for modern frontend projects.
