React 19 introduces several improvements to the core developer experience. Here are some highlights:

- `use()` hook for async/streamed data in components
- Enhanced server components
- Concurrent rendering improvements

  Server components now stream data _before_ hydration. This means faster perceived performance and smaller bundles.

React 19 signals a serious commitment to performance-first architecture in web development.
